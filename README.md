## Features
With Minion, you can control your Popcorn Time client with ease. Here are a few features:
- Control Popcorn Time as if it's running on your phone or tablet.
- Is your screen too far away to read those tiny letters? No worries, we've got you covered: you can see movie and show details in Minion.
- Toggle items as seen and bookmark them to save them for later.
- Watch the trailer of the selected movie, on your client, Minion, or both!
- Stream the playing video on your client right to Minion, for when you're on the loo and really don't want to miss anything.
- You won't loose Minion ever (unlike real remotes..), it's always on your phone! (Unless, of course, you loose your phone.)
- Full video player features. Skip forward, backward, set subtitles, subtitle offset, volume control, etc.
- Simple and clean user interface, no need to be a rocket scientist to control Minion!
- Works without an internet connection ([Read here how](https://help.popcorntimeremote.com/#offline-mode)).
But of course, there's way more! Discover for yourself, browse to [minion.popcorntimeremote.com](https://minion.popcorntimeremote.com) and start controlling yer Popcorn Time application.

## How to use

### Getting Started
To start using Minion, you'll of course need Popcorn Time (duuh) and Minion. You can either download Minion's source [here](https://github.com/ptrteam/minion/releases/newest), or go to [live.popcorntimeremote.com](https://remote.popcorntimeremote.com) to start using Minion right away.

When you open Minion for the first time, it'll ask you for the **connection settings** of your Popcorn Time app. You can find your connection settings inside the Popcorn Time app, under *Settings(the cog icon) -> Show advanced settings -> Connection*. By default, it'll look something like this: *image*. Once you've filled out the settings, **click proceed**. Now the remote will try to connect to your Popcorn Time app.
