## How to use

To start using Minion, you'll of course need [Popcorn Time](https://popcorntime.io) (**not time4popcorn or a different fork**). When you open Minion for the first time, it'll ask you for the **connection settings** of your Popcorn Time app. You can find your connection settings inside the Popcorn Time app, under *Settings (the cog icon) -> Show advanced settings -> Remote Control*. Once you've filled out the settings, **click save**.
