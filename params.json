Control your Popcorn Time client on your phone or tablet with ease, using Minion.\r\n\r\nThis readme is the main source of documentation for everyone working with (or contributing to) the Minion project.\r\n\r\nIf you think that you found a bug, encountered a problem or have an idea that could help out the project, please search for your issue or feature in [the issue tracker](https://github.com/ptrteam/minion/issues) before posting. Once you are sure that no-one posted your issue before, read [the contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) and then [create a new issue](https://github.com/ptrteam/minion/issues/new) or [pull request](https://github.com/ptrteam/minion/compare).\r\n\r\n## Quick start\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://lesander.nl/i/minion.gif\" alt=\"Minion on a simulated iPhone 5\" title=\"Minion on a simulated iPhone 5\" align=\"right\" height=\"320\" hspace=\"1\">\r\n\r\nTo get started with Minion, choose one of the options below.\r\n- [Use the live version](http://live.popcorntimeremote.com).\r\n- [Download the latest release](https://github.com/ptrteam/minion/releases/latest).\r\n- Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/ptrteam/minion.git`.\r\n\r\nMinion will not work correctly in `file://` mode, instead use a (local) webserver (Apache, Nginx, Jekyll).\r\n\r\nWhen you run into a problem, please check the issue tracker if someone has had the same problem. If your problem has not been addressed yet, [please open a new issue](https://github.com/ptrteam/minion/issues/new).\r\n\r\n## How to use\r\n\r\nTo start using Minion, you'll of course need [Popcorn Time](https://popcorntime.io) (**not time4popcorn or a different fork**). When you open Minion for the first time, it'll ask you for the **connection settings** of your Popcorn Time app. You can find your connection settings inside the Popcorn Time app, under *Settings (the cog icon) -> Show advanced settings -> Remote Control*. Once you've filled out the settings, **click save**. \r\n\r\n## Community\r\n\r\nKeep track of news and development about Minion:\r\n- Follow [@popcorntimerm on Twitter](https://twitter.com/popcorntimerm).\r\n- Star [project Minion on GitHub](http://git.io/minion).\r\n- Follow [PTR Team on GitHub](https://github.com/ptrteam).\r\n- Contact us through [hello@popcorntimeremote.com](mailto:hello@popcorntimeremote.com).\r\n\r\n## Versioning\r\n\r\nFor transparency into our release cycle and in striving to maintain backward compatibility, Minion is maintained under [the Semantic Versioning guidelines](http://semver.org/) as much as possible.\r\n\r\n## Copyright\r\n\r\nCode and documentation copyright 2014 The PTR Team.
